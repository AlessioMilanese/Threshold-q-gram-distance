# Threshold q-gram distance

The *threshold* *q*-gram distance (tqd) measures the similarity between two sequences using the concept of *q*-grams, and is able to capture the hapax (uniquely occurring substring) and repeat content in the sequences.

Look at Master_thesis_tqd.pdf for more information on the definition of the tqd and its properties. In Chapter 4 there is the pseudocode of the code present here.
